# Easy Git Push v1.0

Effortlessly push your code changes with a single script. Simplify your Git workflow and save time!

## Note
I created this script because I hate running each Git command manually.

**Author**: Hadi

## Features
- Automatically initializes a project if it's not already a Git repository.
- Pushes changes to the main branch.
- Saves configuration on project directory, so you only need to input the origin and remote repository once. After that, just write the commit message, and the script handles the rest.
- Written in PowerShell script, so you don’t have to install other packages—just have Git installed on your system.
- Lightweight, with a size of only 4KB.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the raw script.
2. Run the script in your project directory.
3. Follow the prompts to push your project to the remote repository.

## How to Use
```sh
PS> easy-gitpush.ps1
```

## Requirements
- Git installed on your system.
- A configured Git repository or a project that you want to initialize as a Git repository.
